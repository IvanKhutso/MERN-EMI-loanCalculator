# LOANS
This repository contains a loan management system(Reducing Balance Method to calculate the EMI) with a client and a server. The server is built using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB, and provides various endpoints to allow users to register, login, take a loan, view their payments and outstanding balances, and make payments. User information is protected using bcrypt and JSON Web Tokens.
